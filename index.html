            <p>In the 2022 NCAA Final Four, the greatest rivalry in college sports faced each other in what would be Coach K's last game. Duke was favored being a 2 seed while UNC was an 8 seed. However, UNC won 81-77, or so says the myth.</p>
            <p>Most UNC students and fans watched the 2022 final 4 game in</p>
            <ul>
            <li>a sports bar</li>
            <li>their home</li>
            <li>New Orleans</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where did you watch?</p>
            <form>
                <select name="poptions"> 
                    <option>Home</option>
                    <option>Restaurant/bar</option>
                    <option>New Orleans</option>
                    <option>Other</option>
                </select>
                <input type="submit" name="submit">
            </form>

            <p>However, there exists a myth that some diehard fans experienced the game, unexpectedly, on a fraternity formal.</p> 
            <p>In a garishly tiki themed beachfront restaurant in the most Myrtle Beach-y area of Myrtle Beach, the entire fraternity crowded around the bar to watch the only two TVs for the entire game. Staying over the 2 hours that they had rented the bar for, they even picked up some locals who cheered with them. After the win, they took to the streets of Myrtle Beach to announce their victory.</p>
